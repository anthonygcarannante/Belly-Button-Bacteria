## Visualizations

#### Bar Chart - Top Bacteria

This visualization pulls the top found in a particular test subject that is chosen by the user in a dropdown menu. The program sifts through the data file to pull the test subject's information and looks for the top 10 bacteria found. It is then put into a bar chart and displayed as shown below.

#### Bubble Chart - Bacteria Cultures per Sample

This visualization looks at all of the bacteria that were found in the selected test subject. It displays it as a bubble chart, where each bubble's size is determined by the amount of bacteria found in test subject. The bigger the bubble, the more of that particular bacteria was found.

#### Metadata Display

This visualization pulls metadata from the data file and displays it for the user's knowledge.

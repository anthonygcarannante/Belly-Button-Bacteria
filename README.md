# Plotly-Challenge

This repository is to display my Javascript knowledge with the addition of Plotly visualizations and D3. The original dataset shows a study that measured the amount of bacteria found in a test subject's belly button. This webpage tells the story of that study.

Technologies Used: Plotly, D3, Javascript, HTML

## Visualizations

### Bar Chart - Top Bacteria

This visualization pulls the top found in a particular test subject that is chosen by the user in a dropdown menu. The program sifts through the data file to pull the test subject's information and looks for the top 10 bacteria found. It is then put into a bar chart and displayed as shown below.

### Bubble Chart - Bacteria Cultures per Sample

This visualization looks at all of the bacteria that were found in the selected test subject. It displays it as a bubble chart, where each bubble's size is determined by the amount of bacteria found in test subject. The bigger the bubble, the more of that particular bacteria was found.

### Metadata Display

This visualization pulls metadata from the data file and displays it for the user's knowledge.
